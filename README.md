# Description
Our Python-based platform helps users to analyze, fetch, keep and retrieve data. It also makes data visualization easier via statistic tools, deriving data from CSV files and MySQL occurs at a click

# The Problem we are solving
In today's era, data is a treasure. Data handling is the most essential part of every organization. The platform we have made caters to the need of every institution whether it is a school, university, or MNCs. Keeping a record of students, employees, and their important information is made easier. Analyzing Data in form of graphs, histograms, pie charts, etc can be done with just a command. The problems our platform solves are as follows -

* Every time a MySQL is used the individual has to write MySQL queries, which is a very cumbersome process
#Our platform just needs the user to input data and there is no need to input any queries.
* While connecting Python to MySQL the user has to write the exact same query as in MySQL this is again time-consuming.
#In our platform the queries get generated automatically.
* Presenting data via different statistic tools at one command from a CSV file was a question

Our Platform serves this problem it can derive data directly from a CSV file and present it in any form which the user
likes. This certain feature is very useful for employees who can now get graphs, piecharts, etc at one go and make their 
presentation more understandable.
Getting the average, mean, and mode values in a table will also be made easy.

# Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into while making this project are as follows -

* In MySQL different tables have different numbers of fields, now according to the need of the user to generate the query just by inputting the name of the table and the data was the toughest problem.

* Converting MySQL to CSV files so that the MySQL files can be analyzed easily was also a big game.

* Making the platform user-friendly, especially for those who do not know much about programming was a challenge.

# Technologies we used
* Python
* MySql
* Visual Studio Code
* Github

In future we will try to add more and more features for a better data handling and data visualisation for users to help them do the neccessary work in less time and with more efficiency and take their presentations and data analyzing to the next level.
